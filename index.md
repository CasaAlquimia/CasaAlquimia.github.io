## The Rooms

![the room](/images/room.jpg)

The hostel is largely constructed out of wood, situated amid the trees. This gives a very rustic feeling of literally being *in* the nature.

There are 3 double rooms with a two-person bed, large windows, furniture, and a private bathroom.

There is one single room and a bunkbed room that are equally sunny, spacious and furnitured, though they have a shared bathroom.

There is a comfortable living room and a well-equiped kitchen at your disposal.
All rooms include free breakfast and WiFi.

## The Location

Around the house, there are four big natural reserves where you can walk in the endless, varied, calming and unique cloud forest.
Here you can see many plants and wildlife unique to this area.

In the are there are many interesting locations such as a butterfly garden, a frog pond, a snake exhibition, a bat jungle, visits to organic farms, coffee tours, chocolate tours, and much more...
You can practice extreme mountain sports such as canopy tours, suspension bridges, absailing from giants trees, mountain railways, etc.
If you would rather enjoy the beach, the Pacific beaches of Puntarenas are a bus ride away, or just over one hour driving with a car.
